# Write a program that plays every possible tic-tac-toe game, and then prints the number of valid, completed games

# Start with empty board
# Make one move -> Then make all the next possible moves based on that
# Deduplicate game states by keeping a simple set of all the game states you've seen
# Once game is completed (tie/win) -> do a count of valid, completed games
# X goes first
